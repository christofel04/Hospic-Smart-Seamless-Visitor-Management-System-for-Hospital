# Hospic-Smart-Seamless-Visitor-Management-System-for-Hospital

This is **Smart Seamless Visitor Management System for Hospital** Created by Christofel Goenawan and Cloud Meatball Teams where the features are :

    1. Touchless Visitor Identification
Visitors are identified based on their facial features through the use of facial recognition technology. With this feature, the system can identify registered and unregistered people in the building, and thus administrators are notified if there are any further actions needed.  

    2. Temperature Checking
Nowadays, temperature assessment is a part of initial check at entry points. The camera used to detect visitor’s facial features will be equipped with infrared sensors that can quickly measure a visitor's body temperature without making any contact with the visitor's skin.

    3. Seamless Access Control
Since visitors are identified by their facial features, everyone will have a unique ID and they don’t need to bring any additional identification devices. The identification device will be placed in front of doors. Only verified users can enter a specific room. The verification is based on the visitation rules in the hospital. When a visitor is allowed to enter, their check in time will also be recorded. It works the same way when the visitor is leaving a room, their check out time will be recorded. This will help to provide a comprehensive visitation log for each visitor.

    4. Artificial Intelligence Powered Visitor Trend Analysis
The system will collect data and give insights to spot patterns of visitor’s visitation. Therefore, hopital can take proactive measures to prevent incidents from happening. This will also help hospitals to plan a better visitation regulation.

    5. Customizable Dashboard
Hospic is equipped with a customizable dashboard where hospitals can easily set their visitation rules. Visitation rules are dynamic and therefore changeable whenever needed. After the rules are set, it will be automatically applied to the whole system.
